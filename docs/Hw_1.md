# Work 1: Examples of robots by morphology
## 1) Materials
No materials required 
## 2) Procedure


- Cartesian Robot (PPP)
    * The most common example in daily life is a desktop 3D printer.
    *It uses straight rails to move along X, Y, and Z axes (width, length, and height).

- Robot SCARA (RRP)
    * A mechanical example is a high-speed laser engraving machine.
    *Its mechanics allow for fast horizontal movements while keeping the tip rigid.
- Articulated Robots (RRR)
    * The clearest mechanical example is the arm of an excavator or backhoe.
    *It works with joints that mimic the human shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
- ASpherical Robots (RRP)
    * A non-robotic example is the turret of a military tank.
    *It can rotate on its base and raise the cannon, plus extend it (in some models).
- Cylindrical Robots (RPP)
    * A real-life example is an adjustable drill press in a workshop.
    *The head rotates around the post (rotation) and moves down to drill (linear).
- Delta Robots (Parallel)
    * A very common example is the "Delta" type 3D printer with long legs.
    *Mechanically, it is seen in professional flight simulators that move quickly.
